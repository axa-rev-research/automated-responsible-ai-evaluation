## Fairness Analysis Results

### Question 1: Is the difference in base rates between protected groups > 5%?

Let's analyze the base rates for protected groups:

* Male, Policy_Status 1: 70.6%
* Female, Policy_Status 1: 62.8%

The difference between the base rates is:

70.6% - 62.8% = 7.8%

Since 7.8% is greater than 5%, the answer is:

**YES**

### Question 2: Do all protected groups have > 400 samples? Consider the sample sizes of each protected group.

Let's analyze the sample sizes for each protected group:

* Female, Count: 86
* Male, Count: 394

Since 86 is less than 400, the answer is:

**NO**

The protected group "Female" has less than 400 samples.

## Suggested Fairness Metric

Use Demographic Parity Difference

## Suggested Mitigation Method

Since a mitigation method is not specified by the user, I will suggest an appropriate mitigation method based on the case description and fairness analysis results.

Based on the fairness analysis results, the difference in base rates between protected groups is greater than 5%, and the protected group "Female" has less than 400 samples. Therefore, we need to consider the Demographic Parity metric.

Given the complexity of the problem and the need to balance error rates across demographic groups, I suggest the following mitigation method:

**Suggested Mitigation Method:** fairlearn.reductions.ExponentiatedGradient with fairlearn.reductions.DemographicParity() constraint

This method optimizes the model during training to minimize disparities in positive prediction rates across groups, ensuring a fairer model. It is suitable for complex binary classification problems and can handle multiple fairness constraints.
