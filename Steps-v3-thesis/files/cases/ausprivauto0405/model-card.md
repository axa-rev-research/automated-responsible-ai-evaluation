**Model Information**

* **Model Name**: Claim Approval Prediction Model
* **Model Type**: Classification
* **Model Description**: The model is a logistic regression-based system that predicts claim approval based on policyholder and vehicle characteristics. The model uses one-hot encoding for categorical features and standardization for numerical features.
* **Model Performance**: Accuracy: 0.60662, Precision: 0.09745, F1 Score: 0.16799, Recall: 0.60835
* **Task**: Predicting claim approval based on policyholder and vehicle characteristics

**Data Information**

* **Outcome Variable**: ClaimNb (binary: 0 for rejected, 1 for approved)
* **Data Features**:
	+ Exposure (number of policy years)
	+ VehValue (vehicle value in thousands of AUD)
	+ VehAge (vehicle age group)
	+ VehBody (vehicle body group)
	+ Gender (policyholder gender)
	+ DrivAge (policyholder age)
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
	+ Base rates for protected groups with positive outcomes:
		- Male, ClaimNb 1: 6.75%
		- Female, ClaimNb 1: 6.86%
	+ Sample sizes for protected groups:
		- Female, Count: 38603
		- Male, Count: 29253

**Ethical and Legal Analysis**

* **Sensitive Attribute**: Gender
* **Laws and Regulations**:
	+ EU's Gender Equality Directive (2006/54/EC)
	+ French Data Protection Act (Loi nÂ° 2018-493 du 20 juin 2018)
	+ French Insurance Code (Code des Assurances)
	+ General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
* **Ethical Concerns**:
	+ Potential for discrimination and unfair treatment of female policyholders
	+ Risk of violating ethical principles and legal standards
	+ Stakeholder considerations: impact on female policyholders, insurance company employees, and regulatory bodies
* **Measurement & Mitigation Suggestions**:
	+ Technical mitigation strategies: remove gender feature, implement fairness metrics, apply fairness-aware regularization techniques, and utilize feature attribution methods
	+ Non-technical mitigation strategies: build a diverse development team, solicit policyholder feedback, and conduct regular audits
