## Fairness Analysis Results

### Question 1: Is the difference in base rates between protected groups > 5%?

Let's analyze the base rates for the protected group "Male".

The base rates are:

* Male: 0, ClaimAmount 1: 50.00%
* Male: 1, ClaimAmount 1: 50.00%

The difference in base rates between the two groups is 0%, which is less than 5%. Therefore, the answer is:

**NO**

### Question 2: Is the sample size ratio < 1.5?

Let's analyze the sample size ratio for the protected group 'Male'.

The sample size for 'Male: 0' is 572, and the sample size for 'Male: 1' is also 572. To calculate the sample size ratio, we can divide the larger sample size by the smaller sample size:

572 (Male: 1) / 572 (Male: 0) = 1

Since the sample size ratio is equal to 1, which is less than 1.5, the answer is:

YES

## Suggested Fairness Metric

Use Equalized Odds Difference

## Suggested Mitigation Method

Based on the fairness analysis results, the difference in base rates between protected groups is less than 5%, and the sample size ratio is less than 1.5. This suggests that the model is not biased towards a particular group based on the base rates or sample sizes.

The suggested fairness metric is the Equalized Odds Difference, which measures the difference in error rates between protected groups. Since the model is not biased towards a particular group, we can focus on optimizing the model to minimize disparities in error rates across groups.

Given the requested mitigation method, Exponentiated Gradient (fairlearn.reductions.ExponentiatedGradient), and considering the complexity of the binary classification problem, I suggest using the Exponentiated Gradient method with the Equalized Odds constraint.

The Exponentiated Gradient method optimizes the model during training to minimize disparities in error rates across groups, ensuring a fairer model. This method is suitable for complex binary classification problems and can be used in conjunction with other fairness constraints.

Suggested Mitigation Method: Exponentiated Gradient (fairlearn.reductions.ExponentiatedGradient with fairlearn.reductions.EqualizedOdds() constraint)
