**Description:** Provide a brief overview of the dataset. Mention the number of records and the context of the data collection (e.g., geographic location, time period). Highlight the primary objective of the analysis or application.

**Use Case:** Outline the intended application or purpose of the dataset. Describe who will use the data (e.g., a specific organization or group) and how the data will be used.

**Features:** List and describe the key features or variables in the dataset.

- **Feature Name and Possible Values/Range:** Brief description of the feature. Types or range of values the feature can take (e.g., categorical, numerical).

**Model and Data Details:** Provide a detailed description of the model and dataset.

- **Outcome Variable:** Specify the target variable/outcome that the model predicts.
- **Number of Classes:** State the number of classes in the outcome variable.
- **Dropped features:** List any features that were removed from the dataset prior to model training.
- **Protected attribute:** Specify the sensitive characteristic used to assess fairness.
- **Base rates for protected groups with positive outcomes:** Provide the proportion of positive outcome for each protected group. Format: [Protected Group], [Positive Outcome Value]: [Percentage]
- **Sample sizes for protected groups:** Specify the number of instances for protected groups and outcome. Format: [Protected Group], Count: [Number]
- **Model Details:** Describe the machine learning model used, including preprocessing steps, feature engineering, and training parameters.
- **Model Performance:** Present key performance metrics for the model on test data, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
