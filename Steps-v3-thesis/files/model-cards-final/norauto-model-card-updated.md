**Model Information**

* **Model Name**: Claim Approval Model
* **Model Type**: Classification
* **Model Description**: The model uses the HistGradientBoostingClassifier from scikit-learn to predict 'ClaimAmount' in the 'norauto' dataset. Categorical features are one-hot encoded with handling of unknown categories, while numerical features are passed through unchanged. Data is split into training and testing sets with an 80%-20% ratio. The model training involves fitting the pipeline to the training data, utilizing features from the dataset.
* **Model Performance**: Accuracy: 0.63319, Precision: 0.68868, F1 Score: 0.63478, Recall: 0.58871
* **Task**: Predict claim approval based on policyholder and vehicle characteristics

**Data Information**

* **Outcome Variable**: ClaimAmount (binary)
* **Data Features**:
	+ Male: Indicator for male policyholder (1 if male, 0 otherwise)
	+ Young: Indicator for young policyholder (1 if age below 26 years, 0 otherwise)
	+ DistLimit: Distance limit as stated in the insurance contract (categorical value)
	+ GeoRegion: Density of the geographical region (categorical value)
	+ Expo: Exposure as a fraction of year
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
	+ Base rates for protected groups:
		- Male: 0, ClaimAmount 1:  50.00%
		- Male: 1, ClaimAmount 1:  50.00%
	+ Sample sizes for protected groups:
		- Male: 0, Count: 572
		- Male: 1, Count: 572

**Ethical and Legal Analysis**

* **Sensitive Attribute**: Male
* **Laws and Regulations**:
	+ EU's Gender Goods and Services Directive (2004/113/EC)
	+ French Data Protection Act (Loi n° 2018-493 du 20 juin 2018)
	+ French Insurance Code (Code des Assurances)
	+ General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
* **Ethical Concerns**:
	+ Potential ethical issues associated with the dataset and its use case, including concerns around transparency, privacy, and fairness.
	+ Discrimination risks: Using sex as a factor in claim approval can lead to discriminatory practices, violating ethical principles and legal standards by disadvantaging certain groups.
	+ Stakeholder considerations: Policyholders, especially those from minority groups, may face unfair treatment and discrimination. Insurance company employees might encounter ethical dilemmas in implementing such a system, and the company itself could face legal challenges and reputational damage. French regulatory bodies, like the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR), and civil rights organizations may need to intervene to ensure compliance with anti-discrimination laws and regulations.

**Fairness Interventions**

* **Measurement and Mitigation Methods**:
The fairness analysis results indicate that the model is not biased towards a particular group based on the base rates or sample sizes. The suggested fairness metric is the Equalized Odds Difference, which measures the difference in error rates between protected groups. The suggested mitigation method is the Exponentiated Gradient (fairlearn.reductions.ExponentiatedGradient) with the Equalized Odds constraint.
* **New Performance**:
Pre-intervention fairness: Equalized Odds Difference: 0.28688524590163933
Post-intervention performance: Accuracy: 0.63319, Precision: 0.67544, F1 Score: 0.64706, Recall: 0.62097
Post-intervention fairness: Mitigated Equalized Odds Difference: 0.21497764530551416
* **Analysis**:
The application of the Exponentiated Gradient method with the Equalized Odds constraint has resulted in a significant reduction in the Equalized Odds Difference, indicating a fairer model. The post-intervention performance metrics show a slight improvement in precision and F1 score, while the accuracy and recall remain similar to the pre-intervention values. The analysis suggests that the intervention has successfully mitigated the fairness issues in the model, ensuring a more equitable decision-making process.
