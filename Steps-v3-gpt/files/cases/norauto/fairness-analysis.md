## Fairness Analysis Results

### Question 1: Is the difference in base rates between protected groups > 5%?
To determine if the difference in base rates between protected groups is greater than 5%, we need to compare the base rates for the protected attribute "Male" in relation to the outcome "ClaimAmount" being 1 (approved).

The base rates for protected groups are given as:
- Male: 0, ClaimAmount 1: 50.00%
- Male: 1, ClaimAmount 1: 50.00%

The difference in base rates between the two groups (Male: 0 and Male: 1) for ClaimAmount being 1 is:
\[50.00\% - 50.00\% = 0\%\]

Since the difference in base rates between the protected groups is \(0\%\), which is not greater than \(5\%\), the answer to the question is:

NO

### Question 2: Is the sample size ratio < 1.5?
To determine if the sample size ratio is less than 1.5, we need to calculate the ratio of the sample sizes for the two protected groups identified by the "Male" attribute. The sample sizes given are:

- Male: 0, Count: 572
- Male: 1, Count: 572

The sample size ratio can be calculated as the size of one group divided by the size of the other. Since both groups have the same size, the calculation is straightforward:

\[ \text{Sample Size Ratio} = \frac{572}{572} = 1 \]

Since the sample size ratio is exactly 1, which is less than 1.5, the answer to the question is YES.

## Suggested Fairness Metric
Use Equalized Odds Difference

## Suggested Mitigation Method
Suggested Mitigation Method: Exponentiated Gradient

Given the case description and fairness analysis results, the Exponentiated Gradient method is the appropriate choice for several reasons:

1. **Fairness Metric Alignment**: The suggested fairness metric is Equalized Odds Difference, which focuses on minimizing disparities in both false positive rates and false negative rates across groups. Exponentiated Gradient is specifically designed to handle complex binary classification problems with multiple fairness constraints, making it well-suited for optimizing towards Equalized Odds.

2. **Complexity of the Problem**: The use case involves predicting claim approval for automobile insurance policies, which is inherently complex due to the multitude of factors influencing claim outcomes. This complexity suggests that simple threshold adjustments (as done by the Threshold Optimizer) might not be sufficient to achieve fairness. Exponentiated Gradient, on the other hand, optimizes the model during training by iteratively adjusting the decision boundary to minimize fairness and accuracy loss, offering a more nuanced approach to handling the problem's complexity.

3. **Training Process Adaptability**: The model uses the HistGradientBoostingClassifier, and the training process involves fitting a pipeline to the data. Exponentiated Gradient integrates into the training process, allowing for the model to be directly optimized with fairness constraints. This method is advantageous because it works within the existing training framework, making it a practical choice for modifying the model to reduce disparities in error rates across the protected groups.

4. **Equal Representation in Data**: The dataset has equal representation of the protected attribute (Male: 0 and Male: 1), with equal sample sizes for both groups. This balanced representation supports the use of Exponentiated Gradient with an Equalized Odds constraint, as the method requires sufficient samples per group to effectively optimize for fairness. The balanced dataset ensures that the method has enough data from each group to accurately assess and minimize disparities.

In conclusion, the Exponentiated Gradient with an Equalized Odds constraint is selected due to its compatibility with the complexity of the problem, its alignment with the suggested fairness metric (Equalized Odds Difference), and its ability to be integrated into the existing training process to optimize the model for fairness during training.
