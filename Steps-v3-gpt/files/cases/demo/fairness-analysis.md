## Fairness Analysis Results

### Question 1: Is the difference in base rates between protected groups > 5%?
To determine if the difference in base rates between protected groups is greater than 5%, we need to calculate the difference in approval rates (Policy_Status 1) between the two protected groups based on gender.

The base rates for the protected groups are as follows:
- Male, Policy_Status 1: 70.6%
- Female, Policy_Status 1: 62.8%

The difference in base rates is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Base Rate of Males} - \text{Base Rate of Females} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 70.6\% - 62.8\% \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 7.8\% \]

Since the difference in base rates between the protected groups (males and females) is 7.8%, which is greater than 5%, the answer to the question is YES.

### Question 2: Do all protected groups have > 400 samples? Consider the sample sizes of each protected group.
To determine if all protected groups have more than 400 samples, we need to consider the sample sizes for the protected groups based on the sensitive attribute "Gender".

The sample sizes for the protected groups are as follows:
- Female, Count: 86
- Male, Count: 394

Given these counts, neither of the protected groups (Female or Male) have more than 400 samples. The Female group has 86 samples, and the Male group has 394 samples.

Therefore, the answer to the question is NO.

## Suggested Fairness Metric
Use Demographic Parity Difference

## Suggested Mitigation Method
Given the case description, fairness analysis results, and the requested mitigation method, the appropriate mitigation method to suggest is the Exponentiated Gradient with a Demographic Parity constraint. This decision is based on the following analysis:

1. **Fairness Metric Selection**: The fairness analysis results indicate a significant difference in base rates between the protected groups (males and females) which is greater than 5%. This suggests the need for a fairness metric that addresses disparities in positive prediction rates across demographic groups. Demographic Parity is chosen as the suggested fairness metric because it focuses on equalizing the positive prediction rates across groups, which directly addresses the identified disparity in base rates.

2. **Mitigation Method**: The user has specifically requested the Exponentiated Gradient method. This method is suitable for complex binary classification problems where multiple fairness constraints need to be considered, and simple threshold adjustments are insufficient. Given the complexity of the insurance policy approval decision system and the identified disparities, the Exponentiated Gradient method is appropriate. It optimizes the model during training to minimize disparities in positive prediction rates across groups, ensuring a fairer model.

3. **Constraint Specification**: Since Demographic Parity has been identified as the appropriate fairness metric based on the fairness analysis results, the Exponentiated Gradient method will be applied with a Demographic Parity constraint. This aligns with the goal of minimizing disparities in positive prediction rates across the protected groups (gender in this case), which is crucial for ensuring that the insurance policy approval decisions do not discriminate against individuals based on their gender.

4. **Reasoning**: The choice of Exponentiated Gradient with a Demographic Parity constraint is further supported by the context of the use case. The insurance company aims to provide a fair and accurate assessment of policy risk while ensuring that individuals are not discriminated against based on protected attributes. By focusing on equalizing positive prediction rates across demographic groups, the chosen mitigation method directly addresses the fairness concerns raised by the analysis and supports the company's objectives.
