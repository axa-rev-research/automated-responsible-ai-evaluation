### Question 1: Is the difference in base rates between protected groups > 5%?
To determine if the difference in base rates between the protected groups (Male and Female) with positive outcomes (class 1) is greater than 5%, we calculate the absolute difference between the base rates for males and females.

Base rate for Males with class 1: 27.68%
Base rate for Females with class 1: 35.16%

Absolute difference = |27.68% - 35.16%| = | -7.48% | = 7.48%

Since the absolute difference in base rates between males and females is 7.48%, which is greater than 5%, the answer to the question is YES.

### Question 2: Do all protected groups have > 400 samples? Consider the sample sizes of each protected group.
To answer the question, we need to consider the sample sizes for the protected groups mentioned in the description:

- Male, Count: 690
- Female, Count: 310

The question asks if all protected groups have more than 400 samples.

- For males, the sample size is 690, which is greater than 400.
- For females, the sample size is 310, which is less than 400.

Since not all protected groups have more than 400 samples (females have less than 400), the answer to the question is NO.

## Suggested Fairness Metric
Use Demographic Parity Difference

## Suggested Mitigation Method
Given the case description, the fairness analysis results, and the absence of a specified mitigation method by the user, I suggest the following mitigation method based on the provided mitigation guide and the identified fairness metric, Demographic Parity Difference.

Since the fairness analysis highlighted a significant difference in base rates between protected groups (males and females) with positive outcomes, and considering the use case involves binary classification (good or bad credit risk), the appropriate mitigation method would be to use the Threshold Optimizer with a "demographic_parity" constraint. This method is suitable for several reasons:

1. **Binary Classification Task**: The use case involves predicting whether loan applicants are good or bad credit risks, which is a binary classification problem.

2. **Need to Equalize Positive Prediction Rates Across Demographic Groups**: The fairness analysis revealed a disparity in base rates between males and females, indicating a need to equalize positive prediction rates to ensure fairness.

3. **Differences in Group Sizes or Base Rates**: The dataset shows differences in base rates for the protected attribute (gender), and there is also a significant difference in sample sizes between males and females.

4. **Sufficient Samples per Group**: While females have less than 400 samples, both groups exceed the minimum recommendation of at least 100 samples for employing this method.

The Threshold Optimizer with "demographic_parity" constraint adjusts prediction thresholds for each group to ensure similar positive prediction rates. This approach promotes fairness by making the model's predictions more equitable across demographic groups without the need to retrain the model. It is particularly effective in scenarios where there are notable differences in base rates and sample sizes between protected groups, as is the case here.

Suggested Mitigation Method: Threshold Optimizer (fairlearn.postprocessing.ThresholdOptimizer with "demographic_parity" constraint)
