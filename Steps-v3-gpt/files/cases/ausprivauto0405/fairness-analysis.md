## Fairness Analysis Results

### Question 1: Is the difference in base rates between protected groups > 5%?
To determine if the difference in base rates between protected groups is greater than 5%, we need to calculate the difference in base rates for positive outcomes (ClaimNb 1) between the male and female groups.

The base rates provided are:
- Male, ClaimNb 1: 6.75%
- Female, ClaimNb 1: 6.86%

Difference in base rates = Base rate for females - Base rate for males
= 6.86% - 6.75%
= 0.11%

The difference in base rates between the protected groups (male and female) is 0.11%, which is not greater than 5%.

Therefore, the answer to the question is NO.

### Question 2: Is the sample size ratio < 1.5?
To determine if the sample size ratio is less than 1.5, we need to calculate the ratio of the sample sizes of the two protected groups, which are Female and Male policyholders.

Given sample sizes:
- Female: 38,603
- Male: 29,253

The ratio can be calculated as the larger group size divided by the smaller group size. In this case, since the Female group is larger, we calculate the ratio as follows:

\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Female Count}}{\text{Male Count}} = \frac{38,603}{29,253} \]

\[ \text{Ratio} = 1.3198 \]

The calculated ratio is approximately 1.32, which is less than 1.5.

Therefore, the answer to the question "Is the sample size ratio < 1.5?" is YES.

## Suggested Fairness Metric
Use Equalized Odds Difference

## Suggested Mitigation Method
Given the case description and fairness analysis results, the appropriate mitigation method to suggest would be the **Threshold Optimizer** with an "equalized_odds" constraint from the provided mitigation guide. 

**Reasoning:**

- **Binary Classification Task:** The use case involves predicting whether a claim is granted or not, which is a binary classification problem.
- **Need to Balance Error Rates Across Demographic Groups:** The fairness analysis did not reveal a significant difference in base rates (>5%) between male and female groups, indicating that the primary concern is not the disparity in base rates but potentially in how the model's errors might be distributed across these groups. Equalized odds focus on balancing both the false positive rate and the false negative rate, which is crucial for fairness in decisions about claim approvals.
- **Sufficient Samples per Group:** Both groups have a substantial number of samples (Female: 38,603, Male: 29,253), which is suitable for post-processing methods like the Threshold Optimizer.
- **Model Details and Performance:** The logistic regression model used has already been trained, and the Threshold Optimizer can be applied without retraining the model. This is particularly useful given the model's performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) and the need to improve fairness without compromising the model's utility significantly.

The **Threshold Optimizer** works by adjusting the decision thresholds for each group to ensure that the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) are similar across groups, thus aiming to achieve equalized odds. This method is chosen over the Exponentiated Gradient because it can be applied directly to the predictions of the already trained logistic regression model, making it a practical choice for immediate fairness improvements without the need to adjust the training process.
