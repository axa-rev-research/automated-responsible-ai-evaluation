**Model Information**

* **Model Name**: Insurance Policy Approval Predictor
* **Model Type**: Classification
* **Model Description**: The model is a logistic regression classifier designed to predict the approval of insurance policy applicants. The dataset includes 13 features related to insurance history, employment, personal status, and financial information. The features 'Gender' and 'Policy_Status' were encoded into numeric values, and one-hot encoding was applied to categorical features 'Property_Area', 'Married', 'Dependents', 'Education', and 'Self_Employed'. StandardScaler was used for feature standardization. The data was split into training and testing sets with a test size of 20%, and the model was trained using the 'liblinear' solver with balanced class weights and a maximum of 100 iterations.
* **Model Performance**: Accuracy: 0.69792, Precision: 0.73529, F1 Score: 0.77519, Recall: 0.81967
* **Task**: Insurance policy approval

**Data Information**

* **Outcome Variable**: Policy_Status (binary: 1 for approved, 0 for rejected)
* **Data Features**: Policy_ID, Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, CoverageAmount, Coverage_Term, Insurance_History, Property_Area, Policy_Status
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  - Quantitative characteristics: The dataset includes 614 individuals with features such as income, insurance history, and personal status.
  - Base rates of sensitive groups and outcome: 
    - Male, Policy_Status 1: 70.6%
    - Female, Policy_Status 1: 62.8%
  - Sample sizes for protected groups:
    - Female, Count: 86
    - Male, Count: 394

**Ethical and Legal Analysis**

* **Sensitive Attribute**: Gender
* **Laws and Regulations**: 
  - EU's Gender Goods and Services Directive (2004/113/EC)
  - French Data Protection Act (Loi nÂ° 2018-493 du 20 juin 2018)
  - French Insurance Code (Code des Assurances)
  - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
* **Ethical Concerns**: 
  - Potential gender bias in the model could result in unfair treatment of female applicants.
  - The inclusion of other sensitive attributes such as marital status and dependents could also lead to biased outcomes.
  - Transparency, privacy, and fairness are critical concerns, especially in ensuring that the model does not disproportionately disadvantage any group.

**Fairness Interventions**

* **Measurement and Mitigation Methods**:
  The fairness measurement method selected was Demographic Parity Difference, which focuses on equalizing the positive prediction rates across demographic groups. This metric was chosen because the fairness analysis revealed a significant difference in base rates between males and females, with a disparity greater than 5%. The mitigation method applied was the Exponentiated Gradient with a Demographic Parity constraint, as it is suitable for complex binary classification problems and ensures that the model minimizes disparities in positive prediction rates across groups during training.

* **New Performance**:
  - **Pre-Intervention Fairness**: Demographic Parity Difference: 0.28891
  - **Post-Intervention Performance**:
    - Accuracy: 0.72917
    - Precision: 0.74648
    - F1 Score: 0.80303
    - Recall: 0.86885
  - **Post-Intervention Fairness**: Demographic Parity Difference: 0.04095

* **Analysis**:
  The application of the Exponentiated Gradient method with a Demographic Parity constraint significantly reduced the Demographic Parity Difference from 0.28891 to 0.04095, indicating a substantial improvement in fairness. Additionally, the overall performance of the model improved, with increases in accuracy, precision, F1 score, and recall. These results suggest that the fairness intervention not only addressed the identified gender bias but also enhanced the model's predictive capabilities. The reduction in disparity ensures that the insurance policy approval decisions are more equitable, aligning with ethical and legal standards.
