**Model Information**

* **Model Name**: NorAuto Claim Approval Predictor
* **Model Type**: Classification
* **Model Description**: The model is built using the HistGradientBoostingClassifier from scikit-learn, aimed at predicting insurance claim approvals ('ClaimAmount') based on policyholder and vehicle characteristics. It processes categorical features through one-hot encoding, including handling of unknown categories, and leaves numerical features unchanged. The model is trained on an 80%-20% train-test split of the dataset.
* **Model Performance**: Accuracy: 0.63319, Precision: 0.68868, F1 Score: 0.63478, Recall: 0.58871
* **Task**: Predicting insurance claim approval

**Data Information**

* **Outcome Variable**: ClaimAmount (binary: 0 for rejected, 1 for approved)
* **Data Features**: Male (binary), Young (binary), DistLimit (categorical), GeoRegion (categorical), Expo (fraction of year)
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The dataset includes equal representation of male and female policyholders (572 each). Base rates for claim approval are balanced across gender, with both male and female groups having a 50% rate of claim approval.

**Ethical and Legal Analysis**

* **Sensitive Attribute**: Male
* **Laws and Regulations**: EU's Gender Equality Directive (2004/113/EC), Anti-Discrimination Directive (2000/43/EC), General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), French Insurance Code (Code des Assurances)
* **Ethical Concerns**: The use of 'Male' as a protected attribute raises concerns about gender bias, potentially leading to unfair treatment. The focus on young policyholders and geographical density may also affect insurance accessibility and affordability, exacerbating disparities. Discrimination risks are primarily related to gender and age, with potential legal and reputational consequences for the insurance company. Stakeholders affected include policyholders, the insurance company, regulators, and consumer protection agencies.

**Fairness Interventions**

* **Measurement and Mitigation Methods**:
    - **Fairness Metric Selected**: Equalized Odds Difference was chosen to address disparities in both false positive rates and false negative rates across groups defined by the sensitive attribute 'Male'.
    - **Mitigation Method**: Exponentiated Gradient with fairlearn.reductions.EqualizedOdds() constraint was implemented. This method was selected due to its ability to optimize the model for fairness during training, its suitability for complex classification problems, and its compatibility with the existing training process. The method aims to minimize fairness and accuracy loss by iteratively adjusting the decision boundary.

* **New Performance**:
    - **Pre-intervention Fairness**: Equalized Odds Difference for 'Male': 0.28689
    - **Post-intervention Performance**: Accuracy: 0.62882, Precision: 0.68224, F1 Score: 0.63203, Recall: 0.58871
    - **Post-intervention Fairness**: Equalized Odds Difference for 'Male' after mitigation: 0.22504

* **Analysis**:
    - The application of the Exponentiated Gradient method with an Equalized Odds constraint resulted in a slight decrease in model accuracy (from 0.63319 to 0.62882) but improved fairness, as indicated by the reduction in Equalized Odds Difference (from 0.28689 to 0.22504). This demonstrates a successful mitigation of bias with a minimal impact on overall model performance.
    - The reduction in the Equalized Odds Difference suggests that the model now makes more equitable predictions across the sensitive groups defined by the 'Male' attribute. This improvement aligns with ethical guidelines and legal requirements, reducing the risk of discrimination and enhancing the model's fairness.
    - The slight decrease in model performance metrics is a common trade-off in fairness interventions, reflecting the balance between accuracy and fairness. The results indicate that the Exponentiated Gradient method effectively addresses fairness concerns without significantly compromising the model's predictive capabilities.
    - This intervention demonstrates the insurance company's commitment to ethical AI practices, addressing potential biases in automated decision-making processes and ensuring that the model's predictions do not unfairly disadvantage any group based on the sensitive attribute of gender.
