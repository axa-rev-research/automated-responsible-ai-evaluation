**Model Information**

* **Model Name**: Vehicle Insurance Claim Approval Predictor
* **Model Type**: Classification
* **Model Description**: This model employs logistic regression to predict the approval of vehicle insurance claims based on policyholder and vehicle characteristics. Categorical features such as vehicle age group, vehicle body group, and policyholder's gender and age were transformed using one-hot encoding. Numerical features like the number of policy years and vehicle value were standardized. The model was trained on a dataset split into 80% training and 20% testing sets, with balanced class weights to address class imbalance.
* **Model Performance**: Accuracy: 0.60662, Precision: 0.09745, F1 Score: 0.16799, Recall: 0.60835
* **Task**: Predicting vehicle insurance claim approval

**Data Information**

* **Outcome Variable**: ClaimNb (binary: 0 for rejected, 1 for approved)
* **Data Features**: Exposure, VehValue, VehAge, VehBody, Gender, DrivAge
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The dataset contains 67,856 records of one-year vehicle insurance policies with features including policyholder characteristics and vehicle details. Base rates for claim approval are slightly different between genders, with 6.75% for males and 6.86% for females. The sample sizes for protected groups are 38,603 for females and 29,253 for males.

**Ethical and Legal Analysis**

* **Sensitive Attribute**: Gender
* **Laws and Regulations**: EU's Gender Equality Directive (2004/113/EC), General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), French Insurance Code (Code des Assurances)
* **Ethical Concerns**: The use of gender as a protected attribute raises concerns about potential discrimination and fairness. There's a slight difference in base rates for claim approval between genders, which could indicate underlying biases. The model's predictions must not unfairly disadvantage or advantage any gender. Stakeholders such as policyholders, the insurance company, and regulators have vested interests in ensuring the model's fairness and compliance with anti-discrimination laws.

**Fairness Interventions**

- **Measurement and Mitigation Methods**:
  The fairness measurement selected was Equalized Odds Difference, chosen for its relevance to binary classification tasks and its focus on balancing error rates across demographic groups. The mitigation method applied was the Threshold Optimizer with an "equalized_odds" constraint. This method was selected due to its suitability for post-processing in binary classification tasks, the need to balance error rates without retraining the model, and the adequacy of sample sizes for both protected groups. The Threshold Optimizer adjusts decision thresholds for each group to ensure similar true positive and false positive rates across groups, aiming for equalized odds.

- **New Performance**:
  - **Pre-intervention Fairness**: Equalized Odds Difference: 0.011526788382003716
  - **Post-intervention Performance**: Accuracy: 0.60640, Precision: 0.09783, F1 Score: 0.16869, Recall: 0.61174
  - **Post-intervention Fairness**: Equalized Odds Difference: 0.008040970158250893

- **Analysis**:
  The application of the Threshold Optimizer with an "equalized_odds" constraint resulted in a slight improvement in model fairness, as indicated by the reduction in Equalized Odds Difference from 0.0115 to 0.0080. This improvement suggests that the intervention was effective in making the model's predictions more equitable across gender groups without significantly compromising the model's performance metrics. The slight changes in accuracy, precision, F1 score, and recall indicate that the fairness intervention was able to enhance fairness with minimal impact on overall model utility. This intervention demonstrates the potential for post-processing techniques to address fairness concerns in machine learning models, particularly in sensitive applications like insurance claim approvals.
