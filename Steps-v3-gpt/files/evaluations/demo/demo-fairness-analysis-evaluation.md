### Evaluation

1. The difference in base rates between males and females is 7.8% / The difference between the base rates is: 70.6% - 62.8% = 7.8% (Full Match)
2. The difference in base rates is greater than 5%, so the answer to Question 1 is YES / Since 7.8% is greater than 5%, the answer is: **YES** (Full Match)
3. The sample size for females is 86 / Female, Count: 86 (Full Match)
4. The sample size for males is 394 / Male, Count: 394 (Full Match)
5. Neither protected group has more than 400 samples, so the answer to Question 2 is NO / Since 86 is less than 400, the answer is: **NO** (Full Match)
6. The suggested fairness metric is Demographic Parity Difference / Use Demographic Parity Difference (Full Match)
7. The suggested mitigation method is Exponentiated Gradient with a Demographic Parity constraint / **Suggested Mitigation Method:** fairlearn.reductions.ExponentiatedGradient with fairlearn.reductions.DemographicParity() constraint (Full Match)
8. Demographic Parity is chosen to address disparities in positive prediction rates across demographic groups / ensuring a fairer model. It is suitable for complex binary classification problems and can handle multiple fairness constraints. (Partial Match)
9. The Exponentiated Gradient method is suitable for complex binary classification problems with multiple fairness constraints / ensuring a fairer model. It is suitable for complex binary classification problems and can handle multiple fairness constraints. (Partial Match)
10. The Exponentiated Gradient method optimizes the model to minimize disparities in positive prediction rates across groups / This method optimizes the model during training to minimize disparities in positive prediction rates across groups, ensuring a fairer model. (Full Match)
11. The insurance company aims to provide fair and accurate policy risk assessments without discrimination based on gender / No match in the text analysis (No Match)
12. The chosen mitigation method supports the company's objectives by addressing fairness concerns / No match in the text analysis (No Match)

### Summary

- Total Points in the List: 12
- Full Match: 8
- Partial Match: 2
- No Match: 2

### Calculations

- TP (True Positive) = Number of Full Match + 0.5 * Number of Partial Match = 8 + 0.5 * 2 = 9
- FP (False Positive) = 0
- FN (False Negative) = Number of No Match = 2

#### Precision
\[ \text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP} = \frac{9}{9 + 0} = 1 \]

#### Recall
\[ \text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} = \frac{9}{9 + 2} = 0.818 \]

#### F1 Score
\[ \text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}} = 2 \times \frac{1 \times 0.818}{1 + 0.818} = 0.9 \]

### Results
- Precision: 1
- Recall: 0.818
- F1 Score: 0.9
