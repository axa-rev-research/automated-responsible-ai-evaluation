**Summary:**
- Total Points in List: 29
- Full Match: 13
- Partial Match: 11
- No Match: 5

**Calculations:**
- TP = 13 (Full Match) + 0.5 * 11 (Partial Match) = 13 + 5.5 = 18.5
- FP = 1
- FN = 5

**Precision, Recall, and F1 Score:**
- Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 18.5 / (18.5 + 1) = 18.5 / 19.5 ≈ 0.949
- Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 18.5 / (18.5 + 5) = 18.5 / 23.5 ≈ 0.787
- F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * (0.949 * 0.787) / (0.949 + 0.787) ≈ 0.860
