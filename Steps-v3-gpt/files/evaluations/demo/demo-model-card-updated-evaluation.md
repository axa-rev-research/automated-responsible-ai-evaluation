**Summary:**
- Total Points in the List: 25
- Full Match: 16
- Partial Match: 6
- No Match: 3

**Calculations:**
- TP = Number of Full Match + 0.5 * Number of Partial Match = 16 + 0.5 * 6 = 19
- FP = 5
- FN = Number of No Match = 3

**Precision, Recall, and F1 Score:**
- Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 19 / (19 + 5) = 19 / 24 ≈ 0.79
- Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 19 / (19 + 3) = 19 / 22 ≈ 0.86
- F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * (0.79 * 0.86) / (0.79 + 0.86) ≈ 0.82
