### Summary

- Total Points in the List: 21
- Full Match: 11
- Partial Match: 5
- No Match: 5

### Metrics Calculation

- TP = Number of Full Match + 0.5 * Number of Partial Match = 11 + 0.5 * 5 = 13.5
- FP = 0
- FN = Number of No Match = 5

**Precision** = TP / (TP + FP) = 13.5 / (13.5 + 0) = 1.0

**Recall** = TP / (TP + FN) = 13.5 / (13.5 + 5) = 0.729

**F1 Score** = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * (1.0 * 0.729) / (1.0 + 0.729) = 0.843
