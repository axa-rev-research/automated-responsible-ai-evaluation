### Summary of Matches:
- Total Points in the List: 20
- Full Matches: 8
- Partial Matches: 7
- No Matches: 5

### Calculations:
- TP (True Positives) = Full Matches + 0.5 * Partial Matches = 8 + 0.5 * 7 = 11.5
- FP (False Positives) = 7
- FN (False Negatives) = No Matches = 5

### Precision, Recall, and F1 Score:
- Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 11.5 / (11.5 + 7) = 11.5 / 18.5 ≈ 0.6216
- Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 11.5 / (11.5 + 5) = 11.5 / 16.5 ≈ 0.6969
- F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * (0.6216 * 0.6969) / (0.6216 + 0.6969) ≈ 0.6568
