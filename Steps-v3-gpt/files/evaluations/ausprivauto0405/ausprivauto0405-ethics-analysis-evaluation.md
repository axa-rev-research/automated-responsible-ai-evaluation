### Summary
- Total Points: 25
- Full Match: 18
- Partial Match: 7
- No Match: 0

### Calculations
- TP = 18 (Full Match) + 0.5 * 7 (Partial Match) = 18 + 3.5 = 21.5
- FP = 1 (since there are no No Matches)
- FN = 0 (since there are no No Matches)

### Metrics
- **Precision** = TP / (TP + FP) = 21.5 / (21.5 + 1) = 21.5 / 22.5 ≈ 0.956
- **Recall** = TP / (TP + FN) = 21.5 / (21.5 + 0) = 21.5 / 21.5 = 1
- **F1 Score** = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * (0.956 * 1) / (0.956 + 1) ≈ 0.977
