**Summary:**
- Total points in the list: 25
- Full Match: 12
- Partial Match: 10
- No Match: 3

**Calculations:**
- TP (True Positives) = Full Match + 0.5 * Partial Match = 12 + 0.5 * 10 = 17
- FP (False Positives) = 3
- FN (False Negatives) = 3

**Precision** = TP / (TP + FP) = 17 / (17 + 3) = 17 / 20 = 0.85
**Recall** = TP / (TP + FN) = 17 / (17 + 3) = 17 / 20 = 0.85
**F1 Score** = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * (0.85 * 0.85) / (0.85 + 0.85) = 0.85
