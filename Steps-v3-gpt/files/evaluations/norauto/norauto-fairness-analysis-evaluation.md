### Summary of Matches
- Total points in the list: 20
- Full Match: 12
- Partial Match: 5
- No Match: 3

### Calculation of Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
- TP (True Positive) = Full Match + 0.5 * Partial Match = 12 + 0.5 * 5 = 14.5
- FP (False Positive) = 1 (as per the rules)
- FN (False Negative) = No Match = 3

Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 14.5 / (14.5 + 1) = 14.5 / 15.5 ≈ 0.935
Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 14.5 / (14.5 + 3) = 14.5 / 17.5 ≈ 0.829
F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * (0.935 * 0.829) / (0.935 + 0.829) ≈ 0.878

### Final Metrics
- Precision: 0.935
- Recall: 0.829
- F1 Score: 0.878
