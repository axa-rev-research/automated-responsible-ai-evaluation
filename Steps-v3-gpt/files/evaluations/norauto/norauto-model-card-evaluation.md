**Summary:**
- Total points in the list: 16
- Full Match: 9
- Partial Match: 6
- No Match: 1

**Calculations:**
- TP = Number of Full Match + 0.5 * Number of Partial Match = 9 + 0.5 * 6 = 12
- FP = 2
- FN = Number of No Match = 1

**Precision, Recall, and F1 Score:**
- Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 12 / (12 + 2) = 12 / 14 = 0.857
- Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 12 / (12 + 1) = 12 / 13 = 0.923
- F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * (0.857 * 0.923) / (0.857 + 0.923) = 2 * 0.791 / 1.78 = 0.889
