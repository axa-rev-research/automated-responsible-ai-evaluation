**Summary:**
- Total points in the list: 24
- Full Match: 10
- Partial Match: 9
- No Match: 5

**Calculations:**
- TP = Number of Full Match + 0.5 * Number of Partial Match = 10 + 0.5 * 9 = 14.5
- FP = 5
- FN = Number of No Match = 5

**Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 14.5 / (14.5 + 5) = 14.5 / 19.5 ≈ 0.744**
**Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 14.5 / (14.5 + 5) = 14.5 / 19.5 ≈ 0.744**
**F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * (0.744 * 0.744) / (0.744 + 0.744) ≈ 0.744**
