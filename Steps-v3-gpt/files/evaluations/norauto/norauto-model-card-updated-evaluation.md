12. Ethical Concerns: Gender bias, potential unfair treatment, impact on insurance accessibility and affordability, discrimination risks related to gender and age, legal and reputational consequences. / Ethical Concerns: Potential ethical issues associated with the dataset and its use case, including concerns around transparency, privacy, and fairness. Discrimination risks: Using sex as a factor in claim approval can lead to discriminatory practices, violating ethical principles and legal standards by disadvantaging certain groups. Stakeholder considerations: Policyholders, especially those from minority groups, may face unfair treatment and discrimination. Insurance company employees might encounter ethical dilemmas in implementing such a system, and the company itself could face legal challenges and reputational damage. French regulatory bodies, like the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR), and civil rights organizations may need to intervene to ensure compliance with anti-discrimination laws and regulations.

19. Analysis: Slight decrease in model accuracy but improved fairness, successful mitigation of bias, alignment with ethical guidelines and legal requirements, minimal impact on overall model performance. / Analysis: The application of the Exponentiated Gradient method with the Equalized Odds constraint has resulted in a significant reduction in the Equalized Odds Difference, indicating a fairer model. The post-intervention performance metrics show a slight improvement in precision and F1 score, while the accuracy and recall remain similar to the pre-intervention values. The analysis suggests that the intervention has successfully mitigated the fairness issues in the model, ensuring a more equitable decision-making process. (Partial Match)

**Summary:**
- Total points in the list: 20
- Full Match: 11
- Partial Match: 8
- No Match: 1

**Calculations:**
- TP = Number of Full Match + 0.5 * Number of Partial Match = 11 + 0.5 * 8 = 15
- FP = 2
- FN = Number of No Match = 1

**Precision** = TP / (TP + FP) = 15 / (15 + 2) = 15 / 17 ≈ 0.882
**Recall** = TP / (TP + FN) = 15 / (15 + 1) = 15 / 16 = 0.9375
**F1 Score** = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * (0.882 * 0.9375) / (0.882 + 0.9375) ≈ 0.909
