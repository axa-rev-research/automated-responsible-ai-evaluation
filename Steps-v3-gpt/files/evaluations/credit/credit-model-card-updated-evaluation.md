Analysis: Significant reduction in Demographic Parity Difference, improved fairness with a minor decrease in performance metrics, better alignment with ethical standards and legal requirements. / **The results of the interventions show a significant reduction in the Demographic Parity Difference, indicating that the model is now more fair. The post-intervention performance metrics show a slight decrease in accuracy and precision, but the F1 score and recall remain similar. The analysis suggests that the Threshold Optimizer with the "demographic_parity" constraint is an effective method for promoting fairness in the model without retraining it.** (Partial Match)

**Summary:**
- Total Points in the List: 22
- Full Match: 7
- Partial Match: 13
- No Match: 2

**Precision, Recall, and F1 Score Calculation:**
- TP = Number of Full Match + 0.5 * Number of Partial Match = 7 + 0.5 * 13 = 13.5
- FP = 2
- FN = Number of No Match = 2

- Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 13.5 / (13.5 + 2) = 13.5 / 15.5 ≈ 0.871
- Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 13.5 / (13.5 + 2) = 13.5 / 15.5 ≈ 0.871
- F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * (0.871 * 0.871) / (0.871 + 0.871) ≈ 0.871

Therefore, the precision, recall, and F1 score are all approximately 0.871.
