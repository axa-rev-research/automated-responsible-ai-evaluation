1. The base rate for males with class 1 is 27.68% / Male, class 1: 27.68% (Full Match)
2. The base rate for females with class 1 is 35.16% / Female, class 1: 35.16% (Full Match)
3. The absolute difference in base rates between males and females is 7.48% / 35.16% (Female) - 27.68% (Male) = 7.48% (Full Match)
4. The difference in base rates between protected groups is greater than 5%, so the answer is YES / Since the difference is greater than 5%, the answer is: YES (Full Match)
5. The sample size for males is 690 / Male, Count: 690 (Full Match)
6. The sample size for females is 310 / Female, Count: 310 (Full Match)
7. Not all protected groups have more than 400 samples, so the answer is NO / Since 690 is greater than 400, the male group meets the condition. However, the female group has a count of 310, which is less than 400. Therefore, the answer is: NO (Full Match)
8. The suggested fairness metric is Demographic Parity Difference / Use Demographic Parity Difference (Full Match)
9. The suggested mitigation method is the Threshold Optimizer with a "demographic_parity" constraint / Threshold Optimizer (fairlearn.postprocessing.ThresholdOptimizer with "demographic_parity" constraint) (Full Match)
10. The Threshold Optimizer is suitable for binary classification tasks / Can be applied to binary classification tasks, which is the case in this scenario. (Full Match)
11. The method addresses the need to equalize positive prediction rates across demographic groups / Is effective in promoting fairness by equalizing positive prediction rates across demographic groups. (Full Match)
12. The dataset shows differences in base rates and sample sizes between males and females / The fairness analysis results indicate that the difference in base rates between protected groups is greater than 5%, which suggests that the model is biased towards the male group. The sample size for the female group is less than 400, which may not be sufficient for some mitigation methods. (Partial Match)
13. Both groups exceed the minimum recommendation of at least 100 samples for employing this method / Does not require a large number of samples per group, making it suitable for the female group with a smaller sample size. (Partial Match)
14. The Threshold Optimizer adjusts prediction thresholds to ensure similar positive prediction rates across groups / Threshold Optimizer with the "demographic_parity" constraint is a suitable method for this case, as it adjusts the prediction thresholds for each group to ensure similar positive prediction rates, promoting fairness without retraining the model. (Full Match)
15. This approach promotes fairness without the need to retrain the model / Is a simple and non-invasive method that does not require retraining the model. (Full Match)

### Summary
- Total points in the list: 15
- Full Match: 13
- Partial Match: 2
- No Match: 0

### Precision, Recall, and F1 Score Calculation
- TP = Number of Full Match + 0.5 * Number of Partial Match = 13 + 0.5 * 2 = 14
- FP = 0
- FN = Number of No Match = 0

**Precision** = TP / (TP + FP) = 14 / (14 + 0) = 1.00
**Recall** = TP / (TP + FN) = 14 / (14 + 0) = 1.00
**F1 Score** = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * (1.00 * 1.00) / (1.00 + 1.00) = 1.00
