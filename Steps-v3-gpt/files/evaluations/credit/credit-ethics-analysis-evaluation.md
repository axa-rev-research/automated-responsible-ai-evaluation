**Summary:**
- Total Points in List: 13
- Full Match: 6
- Partial Match: 7
- No Match: 0

**Calculations:**
- TP = 6 (Full Match) + 0.5 * 7 (Partial Match) = 6 + 3.5 = 9.5
- FP = 3
- FN = 0

**Precision, Recall, and F1 Score:**
- Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 9.5 / (9.5 + 3) = 9.5 / 12.5 = 0.76
- Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 9.5 / (9.5 + 0) = 9.5 / 9.5 = 1
- F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * (0.76 * 1) / (0.76 + 1) = 1.52 / 1.76 = 0.86
