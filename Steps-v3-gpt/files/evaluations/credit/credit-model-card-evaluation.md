**Summary:**
- Total points in the list: 20
- Full Match: 10
- Partial Match: 6
- No Match: 4

**Calculations:**
- TP = Number of Full Match + 0.5 * Number of Partial Match = 10 + 0.5 * 6 = 13
- FP = 2
- FN = Number of No Match = 4

**Precision, Recall, and F1 Score:**
- Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = 13 / (13 + 2) = 13 / 15 ≈ 0.867
- Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = 13 / (13 + 4) = 13 / 17 ≈ 0.765
- F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * (0.867 * 0.765) / (0.867 + 0.765) ≈ 0.813
