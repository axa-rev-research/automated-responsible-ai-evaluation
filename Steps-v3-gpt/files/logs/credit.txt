Demographic Parity Difference is measured as Demographic Parity Difference: 0.19181

Threshold Optimizer with demographic_parity constraint is applied and the post-mitigation performance is measured as 
Model performance after mitigation:
Accuracy: 0.67143, Precision: 0.66165, F1 Score: 0.65672, Recall: 0.65185
Demographic Parity Difference after mitigation: 0.06959
